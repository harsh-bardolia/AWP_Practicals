## Assignment 3


- Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags <h1>,</h1>, <p>, and </p> in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.

- Add an unordered list to your first web page. An unordered list should look like the following when it is shown by a browser:  An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.  An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified with tags <li> and </li>.  After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with <ol> and </ol>, respectively. 

- Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet.

- Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page.

-  HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag. Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is over the link.

- It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your page will also serve as a link that leads to another page. 

- Upload Two .html files.
